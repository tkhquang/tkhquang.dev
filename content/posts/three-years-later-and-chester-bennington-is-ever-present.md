*(July 20, 2017 - July 20, 2020);, it's been 3 years since Chester Bennington's death, yet feels like forever from when I've first started listening to Linkin Park's songs.*

# One step closer to a new genre

It all began when I was in junior high school, while flicking through the TV channels to find the cure for boredom, I stumbled across the sound of someone's screaming. To be honest I didn't like it at all, but I settled on the channel to see if the next songs would be any better. Then realization dawned on me that they were broadcasting a program solely for that band. My brain went *"Fuck, how am I supposed to tolerate this squeaky voice crack any longer?"* but anyhow I decided to stay on the channel and as you can guess, I didn't disappoint one tiny bit. That was the first moment I knew **Nu metal** and **Linkin Park** existed.

Talking about music genres, I was more of a *Pop*/*Emo*/*Punk*/*Alternative* guy, which seems to remain true to this day, but that is not the point. Just like **Bring Me The Horizon** and **Deathcore**, Linkin Park is the only artist in Nu metal I listen to. As clichéd as it may sound, Linkin Park is like a special music genre to me. No other can ever replace.

As I look back at it, the first song of Linkin Park I've heard was [**One Step Closer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qlCC1GOwFw). It's true I didn't like it, however, it's also true that it has grown on me somehow and I can't deny the fact that it was the beginning for me to move one step closer (of course not to to edge) to a new world of music.

# In the end, I'm waiting for the end

> We're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear. Until we tell it, forget it, let it all disappear...

Actually, I'm not that much of a so-called diehard fan to anything. *A bit of this and a bit of that* should be what describe me best, I have interest in a lot of things, yet none has been taken to the extreme. Even with my current job, I might be *jack of all trades, master of none* which is, indeed, not a good thing at all. With Linkin Park, it's no exception either.

I don't listen to every Linkin Park's song. There are only a few of them I listen to regularly, be that as it may, they have a huge impact on my life. Songs like [**In The End**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4), [**Waiting For The End**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qF_qbaWt3Q), [**Papercut**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjVkXlxsO8Q), [**Somewhere I Belong**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsCD5XCu6CM), [**Faint**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYU-8IFcDPw) have been with me through a lot of ups and downs in the roller-coaster of my emotions. I know all the words to the lyrics, every beat to the music. I don't care if the ones around me like them or not, I just want to say that these songs really **saved my life**.

> They say that I don't belong, say that I should retreat, that I'm marching to the rhythm of a lonesome defeat. But the sound of your voice puts the pain in reverse. No surrender, no illusions and for better or worse.

> <cite>Linkin Park (Battle Symphony)</cite>

There is a false saying, *"Whoever cannot save himself, how can he save others?"*. But if I have the key to your chains, why should my lock and yours be the same?

> Nobody's looking to die, when they're happy inside...

It's really shocking how someone that you never meet in person can impact so deeply on you. **Rest in peace, Chester.**

Well, I don't know why I'm sitting here writing all these things, but anyway, check out [**this wonderful song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). Yeah I know, sorry, [**Thank Me Later**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83nYuUfIpfE) 🍨.
