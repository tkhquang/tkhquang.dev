At the end of March, I made the first post of this blog to imply that I would be available for blogging as I had more free time to spend, which seemed so much promising. However, the second post in this blog was made in June which was literally more than 2 months after my first statement.

![The black cat knows where I've been.](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1028454286807318648/A67A184F65270C6A8AA015EBE2E3B64CFBF9EE46/)

You may want to ask me: "Where the f\*ck have you been all this time then?". Well, I was spending my time trying to finish [The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt](https://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/The_Witcher_3_Wild_Hunt/), the game I had been playing since the beginning of... 2016. Yeah it's true, more than 4 years have passed and I still have yet to finish the game completely. I know what you're thinking but the truth is I'm not really that bad. Take a look back at the stats on my Steam Profile, the first 2 achievements I unlocked were on the Independence day of United States of America in 2017. Then the next one was in March, 2018, followed by the one was achieved in December, 2019. I hadn't playing much it seems, Steam says I currently have 137 hours on record playing this game with **56/78** achievements unlocked, which is nice and I will try making it a perfect game on my profile. Not too sure when would that happen as you can see I don't play games regularly like I used to anymore.

![Well... Who would have thunk.](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/1190587229906128095/F6969CF675D0C8C3F3D675F9AF5AE80523F183A4/)

While I was at it, some people asked me why I was still spending my time playing a game that had been released 5 years ago. I know that question might sound dumb to you but if you grew up in a country where most people were proud to be the internet pirates, you wouldn't find the questions like _"Did you ever pay for Winrar?"_ weird at all. Well, I don't want hide the fact that I was one of them but ever since I was able to take care of myself financially, I've been paying for everything I use which is not free. If you take a look at my Steam profile, you will see there are a lot of _old-but-gold_ games, such as [Cultures](https://store.steampowered.com/app/351870/Cultures__8th_Wonder_of_the_World/), [Disciples II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1640/Disciples_II_Galleans_Return/), [Pirates!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3920/Sid_Meiers_Pirates/),... which I don't seem to play at all. Truth is I really don't, I only bought those merely because of the fact that I had a great time playing them in the past somewhere in my pirate life. Anyway, I find it ridiculously silly whenever I hear people tell me that money spending on games is a waste of money. What's more ironic is when these words come from the mouths of those who spend more than $3 a day on bubble tea. If you enjoy playing a game, just buy it. For games like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, trust me, it's worth every penny.
