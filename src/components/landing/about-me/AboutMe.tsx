const ABOUT_ME = `<p>
My full name is Quang Trinh Khac, but you can call me Aleks. I am a
former student of the Advanced Education Program (AEP) in
Information System at Ho Chi Minh City University of Information
Technology. However, for some inexplicable reason, I have not
finished my degree yet.
</p>

<p>
I am a highly motivated, self-starting developer with a good
understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and its modern libraries and frameworks such
as React, Vue,... seeking to launch a career building
web applications and services. The work I provide is of highest
quality, fully responsive, and well-tested in a wide variety of
devices. The code I write is easy to maintain because it is clean,
concise and ordered.
</p>

<p>
Do not hesitate to get in touch with me if you are looking for an
Engineer who can provide:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Semantic HTML/Responsive CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript (Vanilla, ReactJS, VueJS,...)</li>
<li>High-level user experience</li>
<li>Best practices</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>Agile/Scrums (Software development)</li>
</ul>`;
